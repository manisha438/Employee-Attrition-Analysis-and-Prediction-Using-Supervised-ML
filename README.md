## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Removed unnecessary columns  
   - Encoded categorical features  
   - Handled missing values (if any)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized relationships between attrition and features like job role, income, satisfaction

3. **Model Training**  
   - Applied Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest  
   - Trained on labeled attrition data

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Used accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix for evaluation

---

## ✅ Key Insights

- Employees with low job satisfaction or monthly income are more likely to leave  
- Certain departments have higher attrition rates  
- Decision Trees gave better interpretability in HR scenarios

---

## 🔗 Results

- Best model accuracy: **XX%** *(replace with your actual score)*  
- Features like **Job Satisfaction**, **Age**, and **Monthly Income** were key indicators of attrition
